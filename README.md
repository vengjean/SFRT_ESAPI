# MAAS-SFRThelper
Tools to aid in the creation of structure patterns (spheres) or irregular stuctures (straight and angled rods) which can be evaluated or aid in the creation of treatment plans with the intention of not covering traditional PTVs homogeneously.  Spacially Fractionated Radiation Therapy aims to create hetrogenious dose distrubutions with intentionally large peak to valley ratios while underdosing a significant portion of target volume compared with evaluating a traditional radiotherapy PTV.

TO DO (sphere lattice)
- [ ] check appropriate hex or rec spacing -- below spheres do overlap (is hex spacing accurate?)

- [ ] config file spash warning screen / expiration
- [ ] test estimating total sphere volume with formula (or lookup table) rather than finding the volume of each sphere for largest (speed up?)
